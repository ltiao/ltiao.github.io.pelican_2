Inspiration
-----------

I liked how `simple-bootstrap`_ took Bootstrap's `Jumbotron Narrow`_,
to create a clean, minimalistic design. However, it might be overly 
simplistic and lacked the features of, say, `pelican-bootstrap3`_. 

`pelican-bootstrap3`_ sports a lot of great features, but I dislike 
how little thought seems to have gone into the actual design. It 
looks like any another generic Bootstrap site. 

The typography of `martin-pelican`_ is very cool, and I especially 
like the white panel on the light grey background. 

The same can be said of `blueidea`_  which, as far as I can tell, 
is just a blue version of the ``notmyidea`` theme that is shipped 
with Pelican. 

The `chunk`_ theme is neat in how it utilizes 2 columns to separate 
article content and metadata. The `crowsfoot`_ header looks cool, 
but not much else can be said for its content presentation. 

I quite like the footer in `html5-dopetrope`_, but don't like how 
articles are listed in a 1x3 format, side-by-side, horizonally. 
This would only be useful for photography and other visual posts,
and not much else.

The themes `aboutwilson`_, `elegant`_, `foundation-default-colours`_, `gum`_,
`Lannisport`_, `nikhil-theme`_, `simplegrey`_, `sober`_ are clean and neat 
but also seem slightly plain and uninspired.
