.. pull-quote::

   If you don't make time to work on creating the life you want, you're
   eventually going to be forced to spend a *lot* of time dealing with 
   a life you don't want.

   -- Kevin Ngo

.. pull-quote::

   F@&$ motivation. it’s a fickle and unreliable little #&$@ 
   and isn’t worth your time.

   Better to cultivate discipline than to rely on motivation. 
   Force yourself to do things. Force yourself to get up out of 
   bed and practice. Force yourself to work. Motivation is fleeting 
   and it’s easy to rely on because it requires no concentrated 
   effort to get. Motivation comes to you, and you don’t have 
   to chase after it.

   Discipline is reliable, motivation is fleeting. The question 
   isn’t how to keep yourself motivated. It’s how to train 
   yourself to work without it.


Failure and Success
-------------------

.. pull-quote::

   While one person hesitates because he feels inferior, the other 
   is busy making mistakes and becoming superior.

   -- Henry C. Link
