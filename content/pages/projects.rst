*Under Construction*

Coursework
==========

Every semester, I undertake up to a dozen elaborate projects, 
whether it be a practical assignment that requires the design and 
implementation of complex software, or a theoretical assignment 
that requires problem solving, investigative / critical thinking 
and other key skills commonly demanded by academic research.

Therefore, I believe this experience is just as important and relevant as, 
if not more than the experience accumulated from vocational projects.

To see the list of subjects I have completed, understand the nature of
its projects and see how I performed, please refer to `coursework experience`_.
