  Summer Vacation Scholar / Research Assistant (*Internship*)

  Nov 2013 - Feb 2014

  * **Project:** "Social Media Text Analysis for Public-Good Applications"

    Applying techniques from machine learning, natural language processing 
    and information retrieval to develop methods for performing large-scale 
    sentiment analysis of social media (Twitter) text.

    + In terms of software engineering, this consisted of building an 
      experimental framework for performing large-scale text classification 
      and a corresponding web service (API) to lightly wrap around classifiers 
      trained under the framework.
    + From a machine learning and natural language processing research 
      standpoint, this included data collection and preprocessing, experimenting 
      with various classifiers and their parameters, in addition to constructing 
      and evaluating the discriminative capabilities of various features to 
      thereby gain insights into underlying linguistic phenomena.

    The methods developed in this project achieved results comparable to that 
    of the current state-of-the-art and will be integrated and deployed with 
    CSIRO’s social media text analysis prototype.

- **Kointex International Ltd.** Sydney, Australia

  Software Developer / Consultant (*Casual/Part-time*)

  Nov 2012 - July 2013

  Projects undertaken for clients include:
  
  * Developing software for automating, managing and monitoring backups of configuration 
    files,logs, data and charging data records (CDR) for a variety of devices in a 
    large telecommunications network infrastructure (routers, firewalls, access points, 
    mobility controllers and various network hosts.) The backup management web application 
    included features such as

    + managing frequency of backup task execution
    + configuring storage location, format, lifespan of backup file
    + automated indexing and deletion of expired backup files
    + detection and report of irregularities such as abnormal difference in backup file size

  * Developed code for spreadsheet / report generation by extracting information from and 
    cross-referencing client database tables, access / accounting logs and CDR.
