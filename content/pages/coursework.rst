- Description: [COMP6741]_
- Grade: **Distinction**
- Assignments:
  
  * **Assignment 1**

    Using conventional techniques to solve NP-Complete problems
    related to scheduling, SAT solving, and computing domatic numbers.

    The following techniques were used:

    + Dynamic programming
    + Branch and bound
    + Inclusion-exclusion

  * **Assignment 2**

    Solving NP-Complete problems relating to the generalization of
    the Independent Set problem, coined "d-packing", where instead
    of requiring all vertices to be nonadjacent, we require their
    (geodesic) distance to be greater than d. I.e. 1-packing is equivalent
    to Independent Set.

    + manipulation of the **MIPS** software-managed Translation Lookaside 
      Buffer (TLB)
    + implement data structure and interface for the frame table
      (also known as coremap) to manage the physical memory, 
      to support kernel-level memory allocation
    + implement a data structure and interface for a two-level
      hierarchical page table for virtual address translation
    + implement the TLB refill signal handler, which will allocate the
      hierarchical page table and physical pages on-demand as required,
      or otherwise lookup the page table and refill the TLB. 
    + implement OS/161's interface for virtual address space management
      abstraction to interact with the virtual memory implementation.
      E.g. methods for defining regions (text, data, stack) in the 
      virtual address space, methods for copying the virtual address 
      space (to support forking processes), etc.

    Advanced assignment component for extended OS students further
    consisted of implementing

    + shared pages and copy-on-write (for optimizing space utilization
      when forking processes.)
    + implement the ``sbrk`` system call to enable the user-level ``malloc``
      function.

.. [Hao1961] http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/j.1538-7305.1961.tb03975.x/abstract
.. [COMP4418] Knowledge Representation and Reasoning (KRR) is at the core of Artificial Intelligence. It is concerned with the representation of knowledge in symbolic form and the use of this knowledge for reasoning. This course presents current trends and research issues in Knowledge Representation and Reasoning (KRR). It enables students interested in Artificial Intelligence to deepen their knowledge in this important area and gives them a solid background for doing their own work/research in this area. The topics covered may include: Belief revision, Boolean satisfiability, Constraint programming, Description logics and ontologies, Mathematical programming, Planning, Reasoning about action.
.. [COMP3161] Programming language paradigms: imperative, object oriented, declarative (i.e., functional and logic). Theoretical foundations of programming languages: syntax, operatational, axiomatic and denotational semantics. Implementation aspects of central language features, such as dynamic and strong typing, polymorphism, overloading and automatic memory management. Abstracting over programming languages and architectures: byte code approach, component software.
.. [COMP3891] Operating System Organisation and services. Process management: scheduling, synchronisation and communication. Memory management: virtual memory, paging and segmentation. Storage management: disk scheduling, file systems. Protection and security. Distributed operating systems and file systems. Case studies: UNIX & NT.
.. [COMP4141] Computability: formal languages and problems, Turing Machines (TMs), computability, (semi-)decidability, universal TMs, Church-Turing thesis, halting problem, reduction and undecidability proofs, examples; Complexity: run time, space, complexity classes, non-determinism and NP, polynomial reductions and NP completeness, optimisation problems and approximation, randomisation; Languages and Automata: regular expressions and languages, finite automata, determinisation, context-free grammars and languages (CFLs), Chomsky normal form, word problems, pumping lemma, push-down automata, decidability problems for CFLs; Semantics and Correctness: while programs, assertions and program correctness, Hoare logic, loops and loop invariants, relative completeness of Hoare logic (and its role in a proof of Gödel's incompleteness result). [More at http://www.handbook.unsw.edu.au/undergraduate/courses/2014/COMP4141.html]
.. [COMP6741] The course focuses on algorithms for exactly solving NP-hard computational problems. Since no polynomial time algorithm is known for any of these problems, the running time of the algorithms will have a super-polynomial dependence on the input size or some other parameter of the input. 

  The first part presents algorithmic techniques to solve NP-hard problems provably faster than brute-force in the worst case, such as branching algorithms, dynamic programming across subsets, inclusion-exclusion, local search, and measure & conquer. We will also see lower bounds for algorithms and how to rule out certain running times assuming the (Strong) Exponential Time Hypothesis.

  Whereas the first part presents "default" algorithms that one would use without knowing much about the instances one is about to solve, the second part acknowledges that the complexity of an instance does not only depend on its size n. A parameter k is associated with each instance and the parameterized complexity framework aims at designing fixed-parameter algorithms whose running times are f(k)*poly(n) for a computable function f. This gives efficient algorithms for small values of the parameter obtained via techniques such as branching, colour coding, iterative compression, and kernelization (preprocessing). We will also see problems that are not fixed-parameter tractable and not kernelizable to polynomial kernels subject to complexity-theoretic assumptions.
